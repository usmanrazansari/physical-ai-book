# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

This module explores the concept of digital twins in robotics, focusing on physics simulation environments that allow for safe testing and development of robotic systems. Digital twins provide virtual replicas of physical robots and environments, enabling extensive testing without the risks associated with real-world experimentation.

## Overview

Digital twin technology is crucial for robotics development, allowing engineers to test algorithms, validate designs, and train AI systems in virtual environments before deployment. This module covers:

- Physics simulation in Gazebo with gravity and collision detection
- Unity-based digital twins and their applications
- Sensor simulation for LiDAR, depth, and IMU sensors

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- The principles of physics simulation in robotic environments
- How gravity and collision parameters affect robot behavior
- The differences between Gazebo and Unity simulation approaches
- How various sensors are modeled in simulation environments

## Module Structure

This module contains two chapters:

1. [Physics Simulation in Gazebo](./ch1-gazebo-physics-simulation.md) - Understanding gravity, collisions, and environmental physics
2. [Unity Digital Twins and Sensor Simulation](./ch2-unity-digital-twins.md) - Alternative simulation approaches and sensor modeling

Each chapter provides a comprehensive understanding of different simulation methodologies while maintaining conceptual independence.
