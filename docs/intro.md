# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive educational resource on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This book explores the fascinating intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems, focusing on embodied intelligence and AI systems operating in the physical world.

## Overview

This book is structured into four comprehensive modules that progressively build your understanding of physical AI:

1. **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Foundational concepts of robot operating systems
2. **The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Simulation technologies for robotics
3. **The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - AI integration and perception systems
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Advanced human-robot interaction

Each module contains two focused chapters designed to provide both theoretical understanding and practical insights into the field of humanoid robotics.

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Computer science students seeking to understand physical AI concepts
- AI practitioners interested in embodied intelligence
- Robotics researchers and engineers
- Anyone curious about the intersection of AI and robotics

## Academic Approach

This book maintains a rigorous academic tone with:
- Conceptual explanations rather than implementation details
- APA-formatted citations to peer-reviewed sources
- Focus on theoretical foundations and principles
- No code examples or vendor-specific comparisons

## Navigation

Use the sidebar to navigate through the modules and chapters. Each module is designed to be readable independently while maintaining connection to the broader narrative of physical AI.

Let's begin our journey into the world of Physical AI and humanoid robotics!
