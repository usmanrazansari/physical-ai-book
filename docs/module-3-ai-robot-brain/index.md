# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

This module delves into the AI components that serve as the "brain" of robotic systems, focusing on NVIDIA Isaac as a platform for AI-driven robotics. The integration of artificial intelligence with robotic systems enables perception, decision-making, and autonomous navigation capabilities.

## Overview

Modern robotics increasingly relies on AI to enable sophisticated behaviors, from perception and understanding of the environment to navigation and task execution. This module covers:

- NVIDIA Isaac Sim for synthetic data generation
- Isaac ROS integration with existing ROS 2 systems
- Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM)
- Navigation systems using Nav2

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- How synthetic data generation benefits AI training for robotics
- The integration patterns between Isaac and ROS 2
- The principles of visual SLAM for robot perception
- Navigation systems and path planning with Nav2

## Module Structure

This module contains two chapters:

1. [Isaac Sim and Synthetic Data](./ch1-isaac-sim-synthetic-data.md) - AI training through synthetic data generation
2. [Isaac ROS, VSLAM, and Nav2 Navigation](./ch2-isaac-ros-vslam-nav2.md) - Perception and navigation systems

Each chapter builds upon the foundational concepts while maintaining independence for focused learning on specific AI components.
