# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This module introduces the fundamental concepts of Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), which serves as the communication backbone for robotic systems. Understanding ROS 2 architecture is essential for developing complex robotic applications, particularly in the context of humanoid robotics.

## Overview

ROS 2 provides a flexible framework for writing robot software, offering a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms. This module covers:

- Core ROS 2 architecture concepts (nodes, topics, services)
- Python agents using rclpy
- Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) for humanoid robots

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- The fundamental communication patterns in ROS 2
- How to work with nodes, topics, and services
- The structure and purpose of URDF in robot modeling
- How Python agents interact with the ROS 2 ecosystem

## Module Structure

This module contains two chapters:

1. [ROS 2 Architecture](./ch1-ros2-architecture.md) - Core concepts of ROS 2 communication
2. [Python Agents and URDF for Humanoids](./ch2-python-agents-urdf.md) - Practical applications with Python and robot modeling

Each chapter builds upon the previous one while maintaining conceptual independence for focused learning.
