# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of fixes for the Physical AI Book website logo loading issue. The solution involves verifying the current logo configuration, ensuring proper file paths, implementing fallback mechanisms, and optimizing the logo for different screen sizes. This will address the issue where users encounter broken image indicators instead of the proper logo in the navigation bar. Additionally, we'll enhance the navbar aesthetics with modern styling, proper spacing, and visual feedback for improved user experience.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript/React for frontend, Node.js 18+ for Docusaurus
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus 3.1.0, React 18+, Node.js >=18.0
**Storage**: Static files served via GitHub Pages
**Testing**: Manual testing for UI functionality
**Target Platform**: Web application (Docusaurus site with React components)
**Project Type**: Static site generated with Docusaurus
**Performance Goals**: <5 second page load time, logo loads without broken image indicators
**Constraints**: Must not change backend functionality, only frontend UI changes
**Scale/Scope**: Single website with improved logo loading and navbar aesthetics

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Frontend UI changes only | Requirement to not modify backend functionality | Backend changes would violate constraint of keeping backend intact |
